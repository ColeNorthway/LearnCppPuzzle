Goal : Defines the outcome that the step is trying to achieve
Tasks : Provide detail and hints about how to implement the goal


Step 1) Goal : Document the key requirements for this program
	> Plan how your program will be structured at a high level
	A) What are the top-level things that your program needs to do?
		> Board Things
			> Display the game board
			> Calculate random numbers that don't overlap from 1-15
			> Ensure that the top left hand corner starts our empty
			> Can do periodic scans each round to see the state of the board
			> Can recognize user input and implement swaps
			> Can recognize a win
			> Can recognize a quit
		> User Things
			> Prompt for user input each round
			> Sanitize user input
			> Obv we can't block all keystrokes to no result in a short amount of time so we have to implement looping


Step 2) What primary classes or namespaces will you use to implement the items outlined in step1.
	> ALL SHOULD BE IN FINISHED SECTION AS I STEPPED THROUGH THE DEV AND DECLUTTERED THIS AREA WHEN REFERENCING
	namespace Input : Will check for failed input and reset (DONE)
		> This handles all of the necessary checks to make sure that input is ignored that is unnecessary (DONE)
		> Also handles the resets (DONE)
		> Handles loops to keep prompting for valid input (DONE)




Playbook
	1) Get the main loop fleshed out (DONE)
	2) Get the input fleshed out (DONE)
	3) Get random (DONE)
	4) Get the class and its member variables and function prototypes fleshed out (DONE)
		1> We need to create the functions to access the flattened array as if it were 2d (DONE)
			> One type def to <int, Row*Col>
			> One class to be able to implement the logic
		2> Print the 2d array (use column format for that) (DONE)
		3> Do the logic to check the status if the board is completed or not (DONE)
		4> Make the logic for round and moving val around the arr depending on usr input (DONE)
			> First thing we need to prompt the user in main
			> Then we need to have a private var with not access that is a pair<int, int> which is the location of the 0 (DONE)
	5) Implement the functions in the class (DONE)
	6) Fix input validation as its very buggy, it works kinda. (HERE)










Finished
	namespace Random : Will generate the random numbers ----------------------
		> Will have a special function to populate the 2d array passed as a ref
		> This function will have a loop and two arrays
		> The first array will be a sorted std::vector of 1-15
			> This is for the numbers to populate
			> Called numVals
		> The second array will be an array of indexes that have been assigned values
			> Called assndIndexs
			> Predetermined len array of len 15
			> Loaded with value 0
		> The function will pick a random index on the flattened array from 1-15 (ignoring 0 as that is empty)
			> It will use a find algorithm to see if the index is in assndIndexes
				> Use a lambda to pass to the alg if needed
			> If the index isn't in there it will reget another index
				> If the index isn't already in assndIndexes it will break the loop
			> Then it will place the back number of numVals into that index
			> Then it will pop that back of numVals
			> Then it will place that index into assndIndexes
	main() : Will implement the main game loop (Needs some more work)
		> This basically entails the rounds (DONE)
		> Just a while (usrIn != 'q' || gameStatus.status() == 'w') (DONE)
		> Will call valIn namespace after each user input (DONE)
		> Call the round function with the input
	class Board : Implments the board logic ----------------------- (HERE)
		> Will also have a status member variable (DONE)
			> THis is the var that shows the game status
		> Will have a board flattened 2d modern array as a member var <1>
			> THis is the main var
		> Will have a function called printBoard() <2>
			> Do this next to check status later
		> Will have a function called checkStatus() <3>
			> Checks the status after each user input is successful and round() has executed
			> Will see if the game is won
			> If it is won it will print a message out and it will set the status
		> Will have a function called round(char 'usrIn') <4>
			> This will actually read the input and then make a decision on what to do
